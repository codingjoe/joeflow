    Non blocking lock to prevent raise conditions on processes.

    Task especially machine tasks can be executed in parallel. To avoid

    the process state. This avoids tasks to be executed with the wrong
    process state and multiple tasks changing a value of the same process
    field.

    The lock is not blocking to free CPU time for other tasks on celery
